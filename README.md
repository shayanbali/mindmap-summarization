# VideoMind - AI-Powered Video Summarization Tool

VideoMind is an interactive web application that creates AI-powered mind maps from video content, helping users navigate and understand video content more efficiently through visual summaries, timestamps, and interactive exploration.

## Features

- **Interactive Mind Maps**: Visual representation of video content with clickable nodes
- **Video Synchronization**: Click on mind map nodes to jump to specific video timestamps
- **AI-Generated Summaries**: Automated extraction of key points and topics
- **Multiple View Modes**: Split view, video-only, and mind map-only modes
- **Text-to-Speech**: Listen to summaries and content
- **Subtitle Support**: Synchronized transcriptions with adjustable sizing
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Export Functionality**: Download mind maps as JSON files

## Responsible AI Use


### Content Disclaimer
- AI-generated content is supplementary and not a replacement for original video content
- Users should always refer to source material for complete accuracy
- Built-in warnings and disclaimers throughout the interface
- Transparency about AI limitations and potential errors
